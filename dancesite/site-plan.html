        Dancing is not only a beautiful form of self-expression but also a highly beneficial activity for both the mind and body. Whether it's ballet, hip-hop, salsa, or any other style, dancing offers numerous advantages that contribute to overall well-being.</p>
      <p> Firstly, dancing is an excellent way to stay physically fit. It is a full-body workout that engages various muscle groups, improves flexibility, and enhances cardiovascular endurance. Regular dance sessions can help burn calories, build strength, and improve posture. Moreover, dancing is a low-impact exercise, making it suitable for people of all ages and fitness levels.</p>
      <p> Furthermore, dancing has numerous mental health benefits. It is a great stress reliever and mood booster. When we dance, our bodies release endorphins, which are natural mood-enhancing chemicals. These endorphins help reduce anxiety, depression, and stress, leaving us feeling happier and more relaxed. Additionally, dancing also improves cognitive functions such as memory, focus, and coordination. Learning and memorizing dance routines require mental agility and concentration, which can contribute to improved brain function.</p>
      <p>Additionally, dancing is a social activity that promotes social connections and fosters a sense of belonging. Dance classes and social dance events provide opportunities to meet new people, make friends, and create a sense of community. Dancing with others also improves communication skills, teamwork, and cooperation.</p>
      <p>Moreover, dancing can be a form of self-expression and creativity. It allows individuals to express their emotions, thoughts, and personality through movement. Whether it's interpreting music through contemporary dance or telling a story through ballet, dancing provides a platform for personal expression and artistic exploration.</p>
      <p>Dancing offers numerous benefits for both the mind and body. It is a fun and enjoyable way to stay physically active, improve mental well-being, and foster social connections. So, why not put on your dancing shoes and experience the joy and benefits that dancing has to offer?</p>

      <h3>Warm Up</h3>
      <p>
        Warming up before dancing will help you loosen some muscles and to avoid internal injury that leads to a worst experience. We want you to have a best dancing experience whether you are here just for fitness or for intently learning how to dance. In some case, dancing without warming up will surprise your muscles and there's a chance that you will suffer pain in some part of your body. To avoid this kind of injury we suggest the following exercises to let you warm up then proceed to dance.</p>
        
      <p>Exercises:</p>
        <p>• 20 times Jumping jack/ one kilometer jogging</p>
        <p>• Head stretch in all four direction (up, down, left, right) & Muscle stretch from arms, legs, to your feet. </p>
        <p>• 10 push up</p>
        <p>• One whole body stretch</p>

        <p>Jumping jack helps you wake up your whole body muscles this is helpful before you make stretching. Stand straight with your feet together and hands by your sides. Jump up, spread your feet and bring both hands together above your head. Jump again and return to the starting position, do this for 20 times. Jogging is a great exercise for cardio when doing jogging avoid running.</p>
        <p>Do some basic stretch starting from your head push chin up, for 8 counts and do this to the rest of direction. Roll your shoulder to the front for 8 counts and reverse for 8 counts. Roll you hips to the right and reverse for 8 counts. Bend one knee and hug it into your body. Slowly kick that leg up toward the ceiling, straightening it and pulling it toward the torso until tension is felt behind the leg. Point and flex the foot 3 times and perform 3 ankle circles in each direction. Lower the leg and repeat with the opposite leg.</p>
        <p>Once you have done this we are ready to go!</p>
