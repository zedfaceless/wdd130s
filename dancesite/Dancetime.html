                <h2>Let's start in hip-hop called B-boy!</h2>
            <p>B-boy dancing, also known as break dancing, is an upbeat athletic dance style often performed to hip hop music. It’s a great way to get fit and express yourself through movement. It can also allow you to make new friends, especially if you join a b-boy crew. To learn how to b-boy dance, start with basic b-boy dance moves to create a solid foundation of skills. Then, try advanced b-boy dance moves and consider getting help from others to take your skills to the next level.</p>

            <div id="dance1">
                <h3>Step One</h3>
            <p>Do the top rock. The top rock is a basic b-boy dance move that can be used as a single move or as a move between other moves. Stand with your legs hip width apart. Raise your right leg and cross it over so it is diagonally in front of your left leg. As you place your right leg down, hold your hands up so they form a t-shape. Cup your hands and relax your wrists, opening your arms. Then, return to the starting position.[1]
                Repeat the same movements with your left leg, lifting it and crossing it over your right leg on a diagonal. Open your arms as you do this. Return to the starting position.
                Practice doing the top rock move at a regular pace. Stay light and bouncy on your feet, landing softly and smoothly when you place your foot down.
                </p>

                <div id="dance2">
                    <h4>Step Two</h4>
            <p>Try the indian step. Start by standing with your legs hip width apart. Lift your right leg and place it directly in front of your left leg. Raise your left heel and put your weight on your right foot. Keep your arms loose at your sides as you do this. Next, lift your left foot and place it behind your right foot. Turn your body to the right and raise your left foot off the ground.[2]
                Repeat these motions several times, moving back and forward by stepping your right leg in front of your left leg and then behind your left leg. Stay light and bouncy on your feet.
                Lift your arms in a t-shape and use them to punctuate your movements as you step backward and forward.
                You can switch to the other side after you have repeated the indian step a few times. Lead with your left leg.
                </p>
                </div>

            <div id="dance3">
                <h5>Step Three</h5>
            <p>Do the kick and twist. The kick and twist is a popular basic b-boy move that can add variety to your steps. Start with your legs hip width apart. Lift your right foot and kick it forward with your toes facing upward. Next, step to the right one to two feet away with your foot facing outward. Lift your left foot and place it outside of your right foot. As you do this, kick your right foot in the air.[3]
                Repeat these movements a few times, starting with your right foot. Make sure you twist to the right as you move your left foot over your right foot and kick your right foot in the air smoothly.
                Swing your arms as you move, keeping them loose by your ribs.
                Once you’ve practiced this move a few times, switch to the other side, starting with your left foot. Repeat the same movements on the left side.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div id="dance4">
                <h6>Step Four</h6>
            <p>Create a basic combination to music. Pick music that is upbeat and has a 1-2 count. Often, popular hip hop and electronic music tracks are good for b-boy dancing. Do a series of moves one after the other to the music in counts. This will help you move seamlessly from one move to the other in the combination.[4]
                For example, you may do the top rock for eight counts, followed by the indian step for eight counts, and then the kick and twist for eight counts.
                Once you get this combination down, you can try moving a bit faster and doing each movement a bit quicker. For example, you may do the top rock for two counts, followed by the indian step for four counts, and then two counts of the kick and twist.
